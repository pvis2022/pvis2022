Title
: Enhancing the Visual Thinking System: Integrated Innovation of Multiple Thinking Styles

Abstract
: Nowadays, knowledge is accumulating rapidly, together with a huge amount of fragmented information. The ability to think rightly is facing new challenges, for example, the limitation of personal bandwidth and the increased difficulty in information extraction. In this talk, a cutting-edge topic is discussed, about how to integrate various thinking styles so that emerging challenges can be addressed. The visual thinking system is probably the most critical thinking system for human beings, and it receives the most attention from the visualization community. We argue that it is essential to fuse and innovate different thinking styles, along with the visual thinking system. We discuss cases to show different thinking styles, and how they are integrated with our visual thinking ability.
