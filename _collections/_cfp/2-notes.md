# PacificVis 2022 - Visualization Notes

PacificVis 2022 features a short paper track, called "Visualization Notes". The purpose of this track is to encourage young researchers to present their work and discuss with participants including senior researchers there. The submissions can be late-breaking results or work in progress, while they should be novel enough to attract interest from the visualization community.

Original unpublished papers of up to five (5) pages (two-column, single-spaced, 9 point font, including figures, tables and references) are invited. Manuscripts must be written in English, and follow the formatting guidelines. It is recommended (but not mandatory) to submit an anonymized version of your manuscript for double-blind review - in this case, please remove all author and affiliation information from submissions and supplemental files as well as substitute your paper's ID number for the author name. Papers should be submitted electronically in Adobe PDF format. Please provide supplemental videos in QuickTime MPEG-4 or DivX version 5, and use TIFF, JPEG, or PNG for supplemental images.
